Security Council and undertaken with the support of European allies and Arab partners, to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and address the threat posed to international peace and security by the crisis in Libya.” He further stated that U.S. military forces, “under the command of Commander, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) began a series of strikes against air defense systems and military airfields for the purposes of preparing a no-fly zone.” These actions were part of “the multilateral response authorized under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973,” and the President added that “these strikes will be limited in their nature, duration, and scope. Their purpose is to support an international coalition as it takes all necessary measures to enforce the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. These limited U.S. actions will set the stage for further action by other coalition partners.” The President noted that United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 authorized Member States, under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, to take all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya, including the establishment and enforcement of a “no-fly zone” in the airspace of Libya. United States military efforts are discrete and focused on employing unique U.S. military capabilities to set the conditions for our European allies and Arab partners to carry out the measures authorized by the U.N. Security Council Resolution. The President stated further that the “United States has not deployed ground forces into Libya. United States forces are conducting a limited and well-defined mission in support of international efforts to protect civilians and prevent a humanitarian disaster.” Accordingly, he added, “U.S. forces have targeted the Qadhafi regime’s air defense systems, command and control structures, and other capabilities of Qadhafi’s armed forces used to attack civilians and civilian populated areas.” It was the intent of the United States, he said, to “seek a rapid, but responsible, transition of operations to coalition, regional, or international organizations that are postured to continue activities as may be necessary to realize the objectives of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973.” The President said that the actions he had directed were “in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.” He took them, the President stated, “pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.”",6.0,Obama,Social Protection and Order,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,66,2.0,Africa,0.0,LY,Libya,25.0,17.0
